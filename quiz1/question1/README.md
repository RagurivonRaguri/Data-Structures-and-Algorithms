This code removes duplicate elements from an array (arr) and then prints the modified array. It utilizes nested loops to iterate through the array, comparing each element with the subsequent ones. If a duplicate is found, it shifts the remaining elements to the left to eliminate the duplicate. The size of the array is adjusted accordingly, and the final result, which is the array with duplicate elements removed, is printed.
