This program initializes an array with values from 0 to 9 and then reverses the order of its elements. It uses a simple swapping technique, where it iterates through the array, swapping the elements at the beginning and end. After the reversal, it prints the rotated array to the console. The primary purpose is to demonstrate a basic approach to array manipulation in C, particularly the concept of reversing elements within an array.
